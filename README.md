**Problem Statement**:

With the rapid growth of the electric vehicle market, consumers face difficulty comparing EVs 
across dimensions such as:
- Price and affordability
- Driving range
- Performance metrics
- Efficiency and sustainability

This project aims to:
1. Analyse key trends in EV characteristics
2. Identify meaningful patterns using statistical analysis
3. Build a recommndation logic to suggest suitable EVs based on user criteria

**Dataset**

- Content: Electric vehicle specification and attributes
- Features include:
  - Price
  - Driving range
  - Battery capacity
  - Performance indicators
  - Vehicle category
The dataset was cleaned and filterred to ensure consistency and usability for analysis.

**Methodology**

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
   - Handle missing values
   - Filtering relevant EV categories
   - Feature selection for analysis
   - Data type corrections
2. Explarotary Data Analysis
   - Distribution analysis of prices and ranges
   - Grouped analysis by vehicle type
   - Visual comparisons across EV attributes
3. Statistical Analysis
   - Summary statistics
   - Hypothesis testing to compare EV groups
   - Identifying statistically significant differences
4. EV Recommendation Logic
   - Custom class-based implementation
   - Filtering EVs based on user-defined preferences
   - Ranking vehicles by key performance metrics

**Key Insights**

- Clear trade-offs exist between EV price and driving range
- Certain EV categories offer higher efficiency per unit cost
- Statistical tests highlighted meaningful differences across vehicle groups

**Visualisations**

- Distribution plots for EV prices and ranges
- Comparative bar charts
- Insight-driven plots highlighting key trends
Visualisation was used as a core tool to communicate insights clearly and intuitively.

**Tools and Libraries**

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scipy (statistical testing)
- Jupyter Notebook

**Future Improvements**

- Incorporate real-time EV market data
- Add multi-criteria optimisation for recommendations
- Extend recommendation logic to inclue user budget constraints
- Build an interactive dashboard
